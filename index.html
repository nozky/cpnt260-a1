    <h2>Boracay</h2>

    <p>The island comprises the barangays of Manoc-Manoc, Balabag, and Yapak in the municipality of Malay, in Aklan Province. The island is administered by the Boracay Inter-agency Task Force. Apart from its white sand beaches, Boracay is also famous for being one of the world's top destinations for relaxation.
      As of 2013, it was emerging among the top destinations for tranquility and nightlife.</p>
  
    <p>Boracay was awarded as the 2012 Best Island in the World by the international travel magazine Travel + Leisure, In 2014, the resort island was at the top of the "Best Islands in the World" list published by the international magazine Cond√© Nast Traveler. In 2016, Boracay headed the magazine's list of "Top 10 destinations to watch".</p>
       
    <p>In April 2018, the Philippine Government decreed a 6-month closure of the island for tourists to undertake major renovation works, especially of the sewage system, which had become obsolete and insufficient. It re-opened in October 2018, with a set of new rules meant to address a variety of issues. In 2020, the island was closed again in response to the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
